## Game planning
+ Create an array containing all cards
+ Each player starts with half the deck (26 cards), shuffled in a random order.
+ For each round, a card is picked from the “top” of each player’s cards.
+ Whoevers card is highest wins that round and keeps both cards.
+ If the two cards are of the same value, it’s a tie and those cards are discarded.
+ The player who ends up with 0 cards is the loser.
+ Report the results in the view
